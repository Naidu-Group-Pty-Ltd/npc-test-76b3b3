# QA-291SM remediation tracker

**Audit:** `291_Stone_Mason_Reporting_Engine_Error_Audit.pdf` (QA-291SM-20260915),
forty findings QA-01–QA-40 over the six documents generated for 291 Stone
Mason Drive, Kellyville NSW 2155 on 15 September 2026 (Compass = C,
Financial = F, Strategic = S, Snapshot = N, Briefing = B, 10 Year Cash Flow =
T), plus the three symptoms the operator reported with them.

**Branch:** `claude/adoring-hopper-g02tdt`. Checkpoints: `297d8ee` (1),
`e6dd0a9` (2), `b007a18` (3), and checkpoint 4 (this file, the regeneration
findings and the fixes they forced).

This file is the audit-ID-linked record the remediation was asked to keep.
Every finding has a **disposition** (how the audit's classification held up
against the implementation), a **status**, the **evidence** for the status
and the **control** that now exists. Two statuses are deliberately distinct:
*implemented* means the code changed and its tests pass; *verified on a
render* means a document was regenerated and the page inspected. Nothing is
marked resolved because code changed.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented · tested | Code changed; unit/contract tests for the finding pass. |
| Implemented · rendered | As above, and the fix is visible on a regenerated document from the synthetic fixture (see §4). |
| Recorded · evidence gap | The audit's gap is real; the platform holds no data that could close it. The document now states the gap; the decision needed is named. |
| Decision needed | A business or methodology choice the engineer may not make alone. Named in §3. |
| Not reproducible here | Needs production access this session did not have. The next action is named. |

## 1. The three reported symptoms

| # | Symptom | Root cause found | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | "Reports are not being generated in the template forms"; toast *Your chosen template was not used … The renderer could not produce the document* | Every template route ends in the WeasyPrint render service on Cloud Run, which answered **503** (its own front door: no ready instance). The route fell back to the standard pdf-lib layout on all five documents and the notice dropped the status and the engine's words. The deploy workflow has never deployed (3 runs, gate variables unset). | Implemented · tested (the product now names the failure); **Not reproducible here** (the service itself) | `renderFailure.pure.ts`, `weasyprintClient.ts` (classified error, one retry), `render-template-pdf`, `routeReportThroughTemplate.ts` (`engine_unavailable`), `templateDocument.ts` (notice carries status + words); `renderFailure.spec.ts`, `templateRouteRefusal.spec.ts`. Runbook: `RENDER_SERVICE_AVAILABILITY.md`. |
| S2 | Download names "random, not reflecting the report or the address" | `investmentPdfDocument.ts` named every file `<uuid-prefix>_<ADDRESS>_<epoch>.pdf`; the "Financial Download - " / "Steategic Download" prefixes were typed by hand on the operator's side. | Implemented · tested | `reportFileName.pure.ts` → `Due_Diligence_Report_291_Stone_Mason_Drive_Kellyville_NSW_2155_2026-09-15.pdf`; used by the renderer, the template route, the client download and the adapter. `reportFileName.spec.ts`. |
| S3 | Cash-flow PDF: *WeasyPrint render failed (503): \<html\>…503 Server Error…* | Same engine failure as S1; the cash-flow route has no standard-layout fallback and printed the HTML body. | Implemented · tested (the toast prints the operator's sentence; the function answers 503 `engine_unavailable`); **Not reproducible here** (the service) | `render-cash-flow-pdf`, `requestCashFlowPdf.ts`; runbook as above. |

## 2. Findings QA-01–QA-40

Severity and class are the audit's. "Disposition" records whether the
implementation agreed.

| ID | Sev | Audit class | Disposition | Status | Control / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QA-01 | Critical | Confirmed | **Agreed.** `readBaseFinancials` read flat legacy keys the calculator stopped writing; the standalone model seeded no rent and no costs. | Implemented · rendered | Nested record paths (override → record → legacy → default) with `provenance`; `missingInputs` refuses a projection with no rent/price/costs (`assertProjectionComplete`). `readBaseFinancials.spec.ts`. |
| QA-02 | High | Confirmed | **Agreed.** Nothing declared one scenario across the six outputs. | Implemented · rendered | `caseInputsFingerprint` (FNV-1a over the seeded inputs) printed on the cash-flow document; every tier reads the same `financial_calculations` row. `readBaseFinancials.spec.ts`. |
| QA-03 | Critical | Confirmed | **Agreed.** Inspection fees were absent from the standalone acquisition total ($55,032 understated with LMI/legal/inspections). | Implemented · rendered | `inspectionFees` and `lmiAmount` seeded from `initialCosts`; `Inspection fees` line in the wire acquisition; `acquisitionCashFor` includes it. |
| QA-04 | Critical | Confirmed | **Agreed.** "Interest only" label over 30-year P&I arithmetic. | Implemented · tested | `loanLedger.pure.ts` (monthly ledger, IO period honoured) drives projections, key metrics and sensitivities; `loanDetails.structure`/`interestOnlyPeriod`/`interestOnlyPayment` published; chapters print the structure. An IO loan with no stated period assumes 5 years and **says so** (`ASSUMED_INTEREST_ONLY_YEARS`; see §3). `loanLedger.spec.ts`, `financialEngine.spec.ts`. |
| QA-05 | High | Confirmed by reconstruction | **Agreed.** Annual timing with a monthly formula. | Implemented · tested | Ledger balances replace the annual shortcut (year-10 balance moves by −$314 on the reference case; pinned). |
| QA-06 | High | Confirmed | **Agreed.** Headline cash flow ignored the 50-week occupancy. | Implemented · tested | `occupancyWeeks` reaches the engine; rent is collected at occupancy in projections and key metrics; `effectiveAnnualRent` / `potentialAnnualRent` published. |
| QA-07 | High | Confirmed | **Agreed.** Two net-yield numerators. | Implemented · tested | One `totalAnnualExcludingLandTax` basis in the generator; the formula label names it ("Net operating yield before finance and tax"); the engine's `preCalculatedNetYield` is preferred. |
| QA-08 | High | Confirmed by reconstruction | **Agreed, with a SECOND cause found on the regenerated document:** the prompt read a key the engine never wrote, AND the standard renderer's override injection matched `Interest Rate.*?NN%` — the label, anything, then the next percentage — and rewrote every composed "Interest rate 7.5% (+1.0 pt)" row as "Interest Rate: 6.5% (+1.0 pt)" (the same rule family rewrote "Serviceability (LVR proxy) \| 22% \|" as "(LVR: 80%"). | Implemented · rendered | `sensitivityAnalysis.scenarios[]` with labels; `sensitivityRowsForPrompt` reads the record; chapters print the published labels; the three injection rules now match only an explicit `Label: NN%` (pinned by `qa291Contracts.spec.ts`); the WinAnsi strip maps U+2212 to a hyphen so "(−1.0 pt)" keeps its sign. |
| QA-09 | High | Confirmed under the displayed fee rule | **Agreed.** Rent sensitivities froze a %-of-rent fee. | Implemented · tested | `rentLinkedFeeRate` recomputes the fee per scenario; `feeBasis: 'collected_rent'` disclosed. |
| QA-10 | High | Confirmed disclosure defect | **Agreed.** Scenarios and "year 1" undefined; the prompt's growth block was a literal. | Implemented · tested | `assumptions.scenarioGrowth`, `growthTiming`, `occupancyWeeks`, `feeBasis`, `loanStructure` published and printed (chapters, prompt). |
| QA-11 | High | Confirmed disclosure defect | **Agreed.** Series not reproducible from disclosed assumptions. | Implemented · tested | Projection rows carry `operatingCosts`, `interest`, `principal`, `loanPayments`; components reconcile to cash flow (pinned in `financialEngine.spec.ts`). |
| QA-12 | High | Evidence gap | **Agreed.** No eligibility/utilisation basis is held. | Recorded · evidence gap | `evidenceBasisNotes`: the document states that deductions are assumed utilised at the stated marginal rate and that income, structure and eligibility are not held. Decision in §3. |
| QA-13 | High | Confirmed / evidence gap | **Agreed.** Purchase price was assigned to build. | Implemented · rendered | `landBuildSplit` reads the record; a missing split renders "Not stated" and no depreciation is derived from a guess. |
| QA-14 | High | Evidence gap | **Agreed.** Zero land tax not tied to the owner's holdings. | Recorded · evidence gap | `evidenceBasisNotes` distinguishes "none recorded" from "none payable" and names aggregate landholdings as the missing input. |
| QA-15 | High | Evidence gap; double counting not established | **Agreed** (no double counting found either). | Recorded · evidence gap | `evidenceBasisNotes` states whether operating costs are recorded entries or default allowances, "not quotes or bills". |
| QA-16 | Moderate | Confirmed disclosure gap | **Agreed.** Equity headline never bridged to cash committed. | Implemented · tested | Projections chapter's equity bridge (equity at year N, cash to settle, shortfalls funded, total committed, net position before selling costs and tax). `financialRiskDashboard.spec.ts`. |
| QA-17 | High | Evidence gap | **Agreed.** The dimension is an LVR band; nothing about the borrower is an input. | Implemented · tested; **Decision needed** on suppression | Label "serviceability (LVR proxy)"; engine `details` names the proxy; `scoreBasisLine` prints every dimension's basis under the table. Whether to mark the dimension *not assessed* (changing the methodology and every stored score's weights) is in §3. `qa291Contracts.spec.ts`. |
| QA-18 | High | Evidence gap / unreconciled signals | **Agreed, and located:** the Compass never carried 68/100 or "score of 82"; the condense model invented them. | Implemented · tested | `scoreClaims.pure.ts`: a score-shaped claim not in the record and not in the parent is removed at condense and logged (`unrecorded_score_claims`); the validator reports the class on the composite (`unrecorded-score`). `scoreClaims.spec.ts`. |
| QA-19 | Moderate | Confirmed presentation defect | **Agreed.** Omitted dimensions drawn as measured. | Implemented · tested | `readScoreComponents` gated by `dimensionScoresMayBeShown` and `dimensionWasScored` (checkpoint 1). |
| QA-20 | High | Evidence gap / unsupported certainty | **Agreed.** "Confidence: High" beside the check still to do. | Implemented · tested (prompt + validator) | Registry purpose defines the chip as evidence held (Verified / Unverified / Conflicting), separate from the exposure level; the generator exemplar separates exposure, evidence and check; `risk-confidence-overstated` finding. |
| QA-21 | High | Confirmed ambiguity / title gap | **Agreed.** | Implemented · tested | `landAreaScope.pure.ts`: an area on a strata dwelling, or at site scale, is labelled "Recorded area (scope unresolved …)", barred from calculations, with the note in the table. `landAreaScope.spec.ts`. |
| QA-22 | Moderate | Confirmed content regression | **Agreed.** "Residential Property" was a prose fallback that read as a fact. | Implemented · tested | The generator never fills a type; the renderer's replacement rule uses `meaningfulPropertyType` (checkpoint 1); the prompt tells the model to carry the documents' stated type through every section. |
| QA-23 | High | Confirmed labelling / valuation gap | **Agreed.** | Implemented · tested | Snapshot guide: "Modelled purchase price" / "Asking price", never "Estimated Value"; KPI rent caption reads the rent's provenance (`rentProvenanceCaption`) instead of "Current market rate". |
| QA-24 | High | Confirmed taxonomy defect | **Agreed.** | Implemented · tested | Snapshot guide splits observed statistics (with source) from a "Scenario assumptions (not market statistics)" sub-table; the shared KPI captions read "Scenario assumption" (capital growth) and "Assumed for modelling" (rate). |
| QA-25 | High | Evidence gap | **Agreed.** No like-for-like comparison basis is held in the record. | Recorded · evidence gap | No engine control can supply comparables the record lacks. Decision in §3 (a comparables source). Existing prompt rule already forbids uncited growth percentages. |
| QA-26 | High | Confirmed analytical gap | **Agreed.** Listings are not a pipeline. | Recorded · evidence gap | The platform holds no development-approval feed. Decision in §3. |
| QA-27 | Moderate | Confirmed omission / evidence gap | **Agreed.** Heading promised an index the fork never checked for. | Implemented · tested | `socioeconomicContract`: heading loses "& SEIFA Interpretation" and the body opens with the index-not-held statement when no index with a figure is present. `forkSectionContracts.spec.ts`. |
| QA-28 | High | Confirmed source conflict | **Agreed.** | Implemented (prompt control) | Catchment evidence rule in the schools prompt: conflicting sources are each named and marked unverified, never chosen; travel claims need mode, origin, distance and duration or are omitted. |
| QA-29 | Moderate | Confirmed imprecision | **Agreed.** | Implemented (prompt control) | Prompt states that bushfire-prone-land mapping is not a BAL and that a BAL is a site-specific assessment stated only if held. |
| QA-30 | High | Confirmed traceability defect | **Agreed.** `[^prop]`-style tokens printed raw; source lists did not resolve. | Implemented · rendered | `plainMarkdownHygiene`: footnotes numbered and listed under **Notes**; undefined references dropped. |
| QA-31 | High | Confirmed content-routing defect | **Agreed.** The route's note described a filter that never existed. | Implemented · tested | `splitRiskRegister` (financial entries to FIN, property entries to PLDD, unclassifiable to both); the FIN dashboard is **composed from the record** (`financialRiskDashboard`, ordinal 11) with the routed money entries under it and a cross-reference to the Due Diligence register. |
| QA-32 | High | Confirmed identity defect | **Agreed.** Strategic printed the Snapshot's identity; its dashboard was a checklist. | Implemented · tested | `DOCUMENT_IDENTITY` (strategic = "Due Diligence Report"), file name and PDF metadata bound to one tier (checkpoint 1); `riskDashboardContract` renames a checklist body "Property & Location Due Diligence Checklist" with its status line. |
| QA-33 | Moderate | Confirmed completeness defect | **Agreed, and three mechanisms found:** the standard renderer *dropped* the `{{heatmap}}` the prose introduced; the word-cap cut kept a bullet's title and dropped its explanation and the whole "Limitations" half; and a chapter whose own body is blank because its prose lives in H3 children lost its heading (the early `continue` ran before the children rule). | Implemented · rendered | `vizDirectiveTables` writes undrawable directives back as tables (a titled heatmap carries its scale in the header so the anonymous-grid rule of QA-36 does not omit it); the cut works in whole blocks and shares the cap between sub-sections; validator rules `promised-table` and `unbalanced-pair`; a heading with children survives a blank body. |
| QA-34 | Moderate | Confirmed publishing defect | **Agreed.** | Implemented · rendered | Fences unwrapped, "(Rendered Once Here)" removed, underscore emphasis converted, a 2-column table split from the 7-column one (`splitPipeRun`), header/column mismatch aligned (checkpoint 1). |
| QA-35 | Critical | Confirmed structural failure | **Agreed.** A >96-char delimiter row and separator floods. | Implemented · rendered | Delimiter rows canonicalised; separator-only lines and punctuation runs tamed (`normaliseSeparators`). |
| QA-36 | High | Confirmed unusable presentation | **Agreed.** | Implemented · rendered | Anonymous numeric grids get a notice; rows aligned to the header. |
| QA-37 | High | Confirmed omission | **Agreed.** | Implemented · tested | `financialWarningsForPrompt` hands the model the record's shortfalls, shocks, step-up and grade at the recommendation, with the rule that each is reconciled. |
| QA-38 | High | Confirmed contradiction | **Agreed.** "Compression" narrated over an unchanged yield. | Implemented · rendered | `describeYieldMovement` says "unchanged" when nothing changed; `not_assessable` when no rent is established. `yieldNarrative.spec.ts`. |
| QA-39 | Moderate | Confirmed horizon inconsistency | **Agreed.** | Implemented · rendered | `describeGrowth` names the start and end years of the interval it quotes. |
| QA-40 | Moderate | Confirmed visual defect | **Agreed.** | Implemented · rendered | Duplicate legend entry removed (`legendType="none"` on the area); callout clipping fixed by the paragraph guard (checkpoint 1). |

## 3. Decisions the engineer may not take alone

1. **Interest-only period when the record says "interest only" and no period.**
   The ledger assumes 5 years and the document says so. Confirm the product
   convention (5? the loan term? refuse to project?).
2. **Serviceability dimension.** Relabelled as the LVR proxy it is, with its
   basis printed. The audit's stronger ask — "not assessed" rather than
   80/100 — changes the financial score's weights on every stored record
   (`assemble` redistributes weight across available dimensions). A
   methodology version bump is the right vehicle; not done here.
3. **Tax utilisation, land tax, operating-cost evidence (QA-12/14/15).**
   Stated as assumptions on the page. Closing them needs inputs the platform
   does not collect: taxable income / entity, aggregate landholdings, rates
   notices and levies. Decide whether the intake form should collect them.
4. **Comparables and supply pipeline (QA-25/26).** No data source exists in
   the platform for like-for-like sales or approved development pipeline.
   Decide whether to license one; until then the prompt forbids uncited
   growth claims and the register calls its supply view "existing listings".
5. **Render service (S1/S3).** Set the three deploy-workflow variables; add a
   startup probe; decide on `--min-instances 1`. See the runbook.
6. **Year-1 growth timing.** Both engines apply growth before year 1; kept,
   and now disclosed (`growthTiming`). Confirm or change once, in the engine.

## 4. Verification record

See the handover for the exact commands. In summary, on this branch:

- **Unit and contract tests:** the whole vitest suite; the new specs are
  `plainMarkdownHygiene`, `reportFileName`, `loanLedger`, `promptFinancials`,
  `renderFailure`, `readBaseFinancials`, `yieldNarrative`, `scoreClaims`,
  `qa291Contracts`, `vizDirectiveTables`, `forkSectionContracts`,
  `financialRiskDashboard`, `landAreaScope`.
- **Gates at the final commit:** `npx vitest run src/lib/reports
  src/components/reports src/lib/cashFlow src/components/cash-flow
  src/lib/reportTemplate` — 559 files, 9,220 tests passed; the whole suite
  earlier in the session passed except the three pre-existing failures named
  below (and one spec that was mid-edit when that run started and passes on
  its own); `npm run build` — built in 2m 42s; `npm run audit:style` — under
  baseline; `npm run lint` — 0 errors in any file this branch touched (the
  repository's 46 pre-existing lint errors are in files it does not touch).
- **Typechecks:** `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json` (48 pre-existing errors,
  baseline 61 at branch start, none new); `deno check` on every edited edge
  function and pure module (fork 0; condense 6 = baseline; generator 14 =
  baseline; the four render/calculator functions 0 new). Deno was obtained
  through the `deno-bin` npm package with `deno.land` and `esm.sh` imports
  mapped onto local stubs and the npm registry, because the sandbox blocks
  both hosts — the mapping is verification-only and not in the repo.
- **CI gates run locally:** edge column names, error disclosure, fabricated
  data, mass assignment, src missing names, internal legacy fallback,
  verify_jwt declarations, baseline invariants — all pass. The Deno
  post-processor tests pass (11).
- **Pre-existing failures, not this branch's:** `sidebarNavigation.spec`,
  `migrationObjectIndex.spec` and `googleMapsProxies.security.test` fail
  identically on the base commit `06b077d` (run in a worktree); nothing on
  the branch touches those areas.
- **Regenerated documents:** the six documents cannot be regenerated from
  the production rows here (no database access; the journey harness needs
  `.verify/fixtures`). They were regenerated from a **synthetic fixture** —
  the audited property's figures and a composite carrying each defect class
  — through the same renderers the fallback used (pdf-lib for the five
  tiers, local WeasyPrint 69.0 for the cash flow) and every page was
  rendered and inspected. What that proved: every defect class in §2 marked
  *rendered* is absent from the regenerated pages, and the regeneration found
  three defects the code review had not (the injection rewrite, the dropped
  minus sign, the lost heading), each fixed and pinned. What it does not
  prove: the model's behaviour under the changed prompts, the fork against a
  real composite, or the render service. One harness artefact to know about:
  the harness fed the raw fixture to the renderer, so its KPI tiles and the
  composed chapters showed different year-1 figures; the product path goes
  through `investmentPdfSource.ts`, which reconciles the record once for
  both, so the tiles and the chapters read the same healed figures there.

### The regenerated set

Rendered on 15 Sep 2026 from the synthetic fixture (the audited property's
figures; a composite carrying every defect class), through the same code
paths the operator's downloads take — `generateInvestmentPdfBlob` for the
five tiers, `readBaseFinancials` → the projection engine → `toWireProjection`
→ `buildProjection` → `renderCashFlowFromBrand` → WeasyPrint 69.0 for the
cash flow. Every page was rasterised and the key pages inspected.

| Document | Pages | What was checked on the page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investment Compass | 9 | No raw directive, fence, footnote token or authoring note; the promised amenity matrix drawn as a table with its scale; both halves of "Strengths and Limitations"; the risk register intact. |
| Financial Analysis | 14 | Sensitivity rows labelled with their parameter and sign; the composed Financial Risk Dashboard (cash to fund, shocks, debt structure, step-up) with the analysis's money-risk entries under it and no crime/bushfire entry; the equity bridge; the scorecard heading kept with its band. |
| Due Diligence Report | 5 | "Due Diligence Report" identity; "Socioeconomic Profile" with the index-not-held statement; the property-only register under its own heading and lead; the checklist named as one with its status. |
| Executive Briefing | 10 | The invented 68/100 and "score of 82" sentences absent, the recorded D at 39/100 kept; composed tables placed. |
| Snapshot Report | 7 | "Modelled purchase price", observed statistics apart from "Scenario assumptions (not market statistics)"; the dimension table with "Serviceability (LVR proxy)" and the basis line. |
| 10 Year Cash Flow | 11 | "Interest only" loan type, inspection fees in the acquisition, occupancy 50 weeks and the marginal rate in the assumptions, the evidence-basis notes and the case fingerprint under "Worth knowing". |

The artefacts are not committed (they are renders of a synthetic fixture,
not client documents); the harness that produced them is described in the
handover and can be re-run against a production row once database access
exists.

## 5. What is not verified

- The render service's state on Cloud Run, and therefore S1/S3 end to end.
- The generator's and condense function's behaviour against a live model
  (prompt controls QA-20/22/28/29/37 and the Snapshot guide are instructions
  to a model; the validator findings and the score guard are the
  deterministic half).
- The fork against a real composite row (`fork-investment-report` needs
  Deno + database); its pure contracts are tested.
